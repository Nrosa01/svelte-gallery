            The more refs and info you provide, the better. But of course, if you don't have a clear idea of what you want, say you want a post tf art of your character but you don't know the pose, reaction, or setting. I'll try to come up with something that suits your character.

          <p class="text-white text-sm">
            One or many rough sketches will be sent. Once the sketch is approved, payment must be done*. If you take advantage of this to get free sketches, I'll blacklist you. I'll send WIPs during the process (after sketch and line). Changes can be requested before lineart is done. I won't do more than 4 changes. Asking for many changes may incur into additional charges. *When payment time comes, I'll send you a paypal.me link.

            I save the right to post your drawing online as well as on my web. If you don't want your drawing to be public, you must tell me although that would incur into additional costs. I need a 2D ref, if possible unshaded. If the ref is 3D or I can't understand it well enough I will decline your commission.

            Complex designs can incur into additional charges.<br />
            *I can draw humans, but I'm not really experienced with it. For post tf art, I can draw headshots. My struggles are complex body poses and hands. I prefer to avoid drawing humans now except for headshots.

            *NSFW: 
            <span class="text-yellow-300">
              I will only draw NSFW if I'm comfortable with it, just ask about it, I like a lots of kinks such as BDSM, size difference, pet play, watersports, forced, hypnosis, etc.
